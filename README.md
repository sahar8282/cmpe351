This is my operating system project.
I'm sorry I pushed some commits more than once so they are repeated I will be appriciated if you ignore them(because it was my first time working with github).
this code should be compiled and run only in linux using the command ex:(./programname -f inputfilename.txt -o outputfilename.txt).
I have 6 functions for sjfpreemptive sjfnonpreemptive prioritypreemptive prioritynonpreemptive fcfsnonpreemptive and roundrobbinpreemptive.
and for 2 others ( fcfs preemptive->it will show the result of nonpreemptive and roundrobbin nonpreemptive->it will show the result for rrpreemptive) including a warning.
in the menu you can press 2 for choosing the preemptive mode which is false by default.
and the default of time quantum that we used in round robbin method is 2.
thank you.
